## SchedulePlatform-DataScrape

Handles data gathering for SchedulePlatform's backend.

Likely will be used as a python library in the backend, or as a standalone instance, I'm not sure yet. It currently dumps all recent information into an sqlite3 database upon running.


### Setup

Installing dependencies:
```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running:
```shell

```
